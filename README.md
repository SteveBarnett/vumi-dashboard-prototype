vumi-dashboard-prototype
========================

http://praekelt.github.io/vumi-dashboard-prototype

This prototype was built to test ideas and user journeys through the dashboard.

Lots of notes have been added as popovers to provide context and extra information. To hide them, add the class `hide-popovers` to the `html` element. The full set of notes are at https://praekelt.hackpad.com/ep/group/BQ5BG3FkpYK .

Do use:

* the ideas;
* the implementations details;
* the hints contained in the popovers.

Do not use:

* the code;
* the look and feel.
