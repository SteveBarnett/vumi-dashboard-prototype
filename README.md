========================

http://praekelt.github.io/vumi-dashboard-prototype

To hide the popover hint things, add the class `hide-popovers` to the `html` element.

This prototype was built to test ideas and user journeys through the dashboard.

Do use:

* the ideas;
* the implementations details;
* the hints contained in the popovers.

Do not use:

* the code;
* the look and feel.
